This archetype has been designed to support assessment of risk in the subject of care for the identified 'Risk factor', if used within 'Family prevalence' SLOT in the EVALUATION.health_risk archetype.

It could also be used to document the presence of affected family in other archetypes in which the index data element has already been identified. For example, it could document the number of affected family members for an identified diagnosis, by insertion into the 'Specific details' SLOT of the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype.">
