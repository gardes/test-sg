This archetype is designed to be used in SLOTs within clinically appropriate OBSERVATION or other CLUSTER archetypes as part of recording the findings on clinical examination - for example nested within OBSERVATION.exam or CLUSTER.pinna_mastoid.

Inspection of the skin is assumed to be done using direct visualisation. If a device is used, it should be recorded as part of the method of examination in the ENTRY archetype - for example, the OBSERVATION.exam family of archetypes.">
