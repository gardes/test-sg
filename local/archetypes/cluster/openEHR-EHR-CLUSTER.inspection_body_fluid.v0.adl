			purpose = <"For recording the findings observed during the inspection of body fluid at a body site or from an identified body source, usually as part of a physical examination by a clinician.">
			use = <"Use to record a narrative description, structured details and clinical interpretation about findings observed during the inspection of any body fluid from an identified body site or source, usually as part of a physical examination by a clinician.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used as the framework for recording any body fluid. In order to record examination findings for multicomponent body fluids such as amniotic fluid that may also contain obvious blood, meconium or pus, it is intended that one instance of this archetype be used to describe the amniotic fluid overall and additional instances of this same archetype will be nested with the 'Specific findings' SLOT to represent each of blood, meconium and pus.

Body fluid is a liquid that originates from the human body, and this archetype is intended to support detailed description of:
- normal physiological fluids; 
- physiological fluids that may be altered due to a pathological process; and
- fluids generated as part of a pathological process within the body.

Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Amniotic fluid;
- Blood and plasma;
- Cerebrospinal fluid;
- Discharge;
- Excreta, including urine and liquid faeces;
- Pus;
- Saliva;
- Sputum;
- Synovial fluid;
- Sweat; and
- Vomitus.

While this archetype will most likely be used in the context of a living subject, it is also appropriate to use in recording autopsy findings.

Context of the body site or source will usually be carried in the archetypes in which it is nested, including but not limited to:
-  in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within many of the CLUSTER.exam family of archetypes and related inspection and palpation archetypes;
-  in the 'Additional details' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.urinalysis, the OBSERVATION.fluid_output archetypes; and
- within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical description' data element.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording measurements of fluid volume - use OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose. For example OBSERVATION.fluid_output.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom_sign.

Not to be used to record the results of a urinalysis test - use OBSERVATION.urinalysis. This archetype may be included in the 'Additional details' SLOT to provide additional context to the test result.

Not to be used to record the details of a specimen for use in laboratory testing - use CLUSTER.specimen.">
