The specimen may either be a solid tissue excision, or a sampling of some fluid from within the organism. 

By definition, a specimen can only be contained by one container - splitting a single \"sample\" across multiple containers creates multiple specimens. If the specimens are solid, a single container may contain multiple different specimens, and each will have it's own specimen archetype instance.">

			misuse = <"The specimen archetype is only for specimens extracted from individual living organisms; it is not used for specimens extracted from care provision devices etc. 

The specimen details do not include the state of the individual from which specimen was taken (fasting, pre-dose, sitting, exercising etc); these must be specified in the Entry archetypes.

The specimen archetype is only suitable for use with single specimens; a different archetype is be used for describing collections of specimens.

The specimen archetype does not cover the laboratory processes for handling and reporting on a specimen. ">

In some cases, it is ambiguous whether the identifier belongs to the container or the specimen, since it is assigned after the specimen is placed in the container, and they are never parted. If the identifier is assigned to the container prior to it's selection for the specimen, then it is a container identifier. If consideration of the workflows associated with multiple solid specimens in a container doesn't indicate that the identifier is a container identifier, it should be considered to be a specimen identifier.">

Within the context of an Instruction, the date/time of collection is optional and may be used to indicate when collection should occur. When used in an Action, or an Observation, the date and time is mandatory.
