			use = <"Use to record information about the activities required to carry out a testing activity, including the planning, scheduling, performance, suspension, cancellation, documentation and completion. This is done by the recording any or all of the data element against appropriate activities, as defined by the 'Pathway' care steps in this archetype.

The scope of this archetype encompasses activities for a broad range of simple clinical testing activities performed for evaluative, investigative, screening or diagnostic purposes. Complex testing activities, in particular where there may be more specific pathway steps or additional data elements, should be recorded using specific archetypes for the purpose.

Additional structured and detailed information about the test can be captured using purpose-specific archetypes inserted into the 'Test detail' slot, where required.

'End date/time' has not been specifically modelled in this archetype as this is the date/time that is recorded (per the reference model) as each action or care pathway step is completed.

Within the context of an test report, this archetype will be used to record only what was done during the test itself. Separate archetypes will be used to record the other required components of the test report, including the actual results (as OBSERVATIONs) and plans for followup (as INSTRUCTIONs).

In practice, many tests (for example, in ambulatory care) will occur once and not be ordered in advance. The pathway step, ‘Test completed’ (or ‘Failed attempt’, or 'Test abandoned’) will be recorded and the details added. In some cases a recurring test will be ordered, and in this situation data against the 'Test performed' step will be recorded on each occasion, leaving the instruction in the active state. When the last occurrence is recorded the ‘Test completed’ action is recorded showing that this order is now in the closed state.

In other situations there may be a formal order for a test using a corresponding INSTRUCTION archetype. This ACTION archetype can then be used to record the workflow of when and how the order has been carried out.">
