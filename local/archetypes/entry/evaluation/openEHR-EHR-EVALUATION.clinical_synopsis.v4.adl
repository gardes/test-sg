It may also include health-related information pertinent to the subject of care, and a clinical interpretation of relevant investigations and observations performed on the subject of care (including pathology and diagnostic imaging).

A subject of care-entered or carer-entered clinical synopsis contains information such as reporting on one or more health events, summaries of health issues and assessments of health problems. Health events include blood pressure measurements, descriptions of instances of adverse reactions to food and reflections on mood.">

When used by the subject of care or a nominated representative (including carer), it is used to provide information such as descriptions of health events, summaries of health issues and assessments of health problems as perceived by the subject of care and/or a nominated representative.">
