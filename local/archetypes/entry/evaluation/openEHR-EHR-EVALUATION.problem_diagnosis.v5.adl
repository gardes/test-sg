To record details about a problem or diagnosis by a clinician.
">
			use = <"
Use to record detailed information about problems or diagnoses recognised by a clinician. There are many uses including: recording a Diagnosis during an Encounter; populating a Problem List or a Summary Statement, such as a Discharge Summary.

Use to record all problems or diagnoses, including those with context-specific qualifiers such as past/present, primary/secondary, active/inactive etc. These qualifiers can be documented separately and included in the ‘Status’ data group, because their use varies in different settings.
">
			keywords = <"issue", "condition", "problem", "concern", "diagnosis", "criteria", "illness", "disease", "disorder">
			misuse = <"
Not to be used to record 'Differential Diagnoses' - use the Differential Diagnosis DCM.

Not to be used to record 'Reason for Encounter' - use the Reason for Encounter DCM.

Not to be used to record 'Presenting Complaint' - which is information captured early in the encounter, usually prior to full assessment and will be represented using a separate DCM.

Not to be used to record procedures - use the Procedure DCM.

Not to be used to record symptoms or signs - these should be recorded as part of a patient story or history. A problem such as 'Chest pain' may masquerade as a symptom, however in this context we are recording it as a problem the person has.
