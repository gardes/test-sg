This archetype has specifically been designed to avoid the need to use flags or terminology to express negation about any procedures performed within the health record. 

Exclusion statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording. For example: exclusion of appendicectomy during a consultation or emergency room visit for abdominal pain is only relevant at the time of recording and is effectively obsolete if the subsequent diagnosis is appendicitis and an appendicectomy performed.">
