			purpose = <"
To record health information that will inform a clinical assessment of the propensity of an individual for a future reaction to a substance, class of substance or agent.

To record information about exposure events to a substance, building up a persisting and evolving summary over time.

To record information about any adverse reaction, including:
- immune mediated reactions Types I-IV (including allergic reactions and hypersensitivities), and
- non-immune mediated reactions (including pseudoallergic reactions, side effects, intolerances, drug toxicities (e.

g. Gentamycin), drug-drug interactions, food-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions and idiosyncratic reactions).
">
			use = <"
Use to record all information about adverse reactions (including allergic reactions) that are required to support direct clinical care of an individual, safe exchange of information about adverse reactions and to enable computerised knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts.

Use to provide a single place within the health record to record a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions, including:
- record cumulative information about each exposure to a known substance, class of substance or agent; and
- record a clinician's opinion that administration of, or exposure to, a substance or agent is absolutely contraindicated.

Can also be used to record an individual's reflections on their adverse reactions.

Use to record the information about an adverse reaction that might be exchanged with other systems, including as part of an adverse reaction report sent to statutory authorities. It is likely that a formal Adverse Reaction report will require additional information that will be captured in the health record using other data groups, for example medication and problem/diagnosis etc.

This data group has been designed to allow recording of information about a more generic substance, class of substance or agent, and then allow more specific details to be recorded including identification of the specific substance on a per exposure basis, including links to other parts of the health record where further details may be located. Note: it is possible on second or subsequent exposures to a previously identified substance for a reaction not to occur and this data group allows for these events to be closely linked in a way that will assist in determining if the adverse reaction has been incorrectly identified.

In addition, it is anticipated that in some very specific clinical situations, such as immunologist assessment or for use in clinical trials, more information about the adverse reaction may be required. Additional details can be added as cluster data groups using the ‘Further Exposure Details’ and ‘Further Reaction Details’ slots. Similarly, additional details that are required only for reporting can be added using the ‘Reporting Details’ slot.

The act of recording an adverse reaction in the health record implies there is a potential hazard for the individual if they are exposed to the same substance/agent in the future - a relative contraindication. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/agent again, for example, following a manifestation of anaphylaxis, the 'Absolute contraindication' data flag should be recorded as ‘True’. Note: Conversely, a statement about ‘Severity’ of propensity (with possible values such as Mild, Moderate and Severe) has deliberately not been modelled explicitly. Predicting or estimating the grade of possible severity of a future reaction is not safe to record and persist in data, except where it is absolutely clear that the risk of deliberate re-exposure is unacceptable and highly likely to cause significant harm, such as a previous manifestation of anaphylaxis, and in this case the ‘Absolute contraindication’ data flag should be used.

Valuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:
- statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure,
- source of the information/reporter, and
- a flag for absolute contra-indication.

Second-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.

			misuse = <"
1. Not to be used for recording the absence (or negative presence) of a reaction to 'any substances' or to identified substances – use the EVALUATION.exclusion family of data groups to express a positive statement of exclusion.
3. Not to be used for recording that no information was able to be obtained about the Adverse Reaction status of a patient. Use the EVALUATION.absent_information family of data group to record a positive statement of absent information about Adverse Reactions was able to be obtained, for example, if a non-cooperative patient refuses to answer questions.
5. Not to be used to record adverse events, including failures of clinical process, interventions or products. For example: abnormal use or mistakes/errors made in administration of an agent or substance; mislabelling; harm or injury caused by an intervention or procedure; overdose, etc.
7. Not to be used for recording alerts.
