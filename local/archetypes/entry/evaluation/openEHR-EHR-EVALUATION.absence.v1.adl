This archetype has been designed to be used within SLOTS in persistent COMPOSITIONS such as Medication List, Problem List, or Adverse Reaction List.

Absence statements can only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording.

This archetype has been designed specifically to avoid the need to use of flags to express negation about any item within the health record.">
