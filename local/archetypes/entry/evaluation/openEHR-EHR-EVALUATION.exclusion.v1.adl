This detailed clinical model (DCM) avoids the need to use terminology to express negation about any item within the health record. Specialisations of this DCM will capture specific and more detailed information about common exclusions, such as problems or diagnoses. This DCM has been deliberately kept simple and open in order to capture simple statements about anything that may be usefully recorded as absent or excluded within the health record.">
