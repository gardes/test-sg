Monitor for hematoma/bleeding with the following frequency: q15min x 1hour, q30min x 1 hour until bedrest complete. Alternative frequency of vitals may be ordered as per Radiologist. Monitor venous or arterial site. If bleeding/swelling occurs, apply pressure STAT as per protocol. If angioseal or percutaneous closure device insitu ensure proper technique followed.;Do not bend peripheral extremity distal to puncture site.;Leave dressing insitu and change if soiled. Assess for hematoma/bleeding at the puncture site.;Notify Radiologist if procedural related concerns arise.;Keep existing IV/saline lock to keep vein open until sheath is pulled, discontinue running IV, keep saline lock IV until patient has ambulated and has no signs of bleeding.;Resume previous diet as tolerated post sheath removal.;Post procedural medications may be prescribed as per the Radiologist’s order.;Registered Nurse needs to be present for patient’s first ambulation to monitor groin for bleeding.;Admit discharge and transfer will be determined at the provider's discretion. Admission to ICU will be arranged. (Edmonton Zone) If continuous infusion of TPA is used, admit to ICU/Observation bed on continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring. (Central Zone) Patient will be returned to ICU for observation with sheath and catheter still in place.Follow-up imaging or bloodwork to be ordered by the Radiologist.Outpatient Post Procedure Care : Patient will be admitted overnight to ICU/obs unit if sheath expected to stay insitu; if continuous infusions expected or patient condition warrants. Ambulation post sheath removal post bedrest 4 hours as per Radiologist orders. Compression stocking worn as per orders. If continuous infusion of TPA is used, admit to ICU/obs bed on continuous cadiorespiratory monitoring. Transfer to unit on continuous monitoring accompanied by RN, if VSS, NVSS, and no patient concerns noted. If continuous infusion of TPA is not used and patient condition stable, as per orders patient may be discharged home post sheath removal 3-4 hours as per orders after ambulation and hemostasis. Discharge Teaching: give patient Angiogram discharge information form. See information form for further information. Teaching should include recovery from anesthetic or sedation, pain control, procedure related symptoms, activity restrictions, dressing care and post-procedural complications. Unusual symptoms including neurological or spinal changes, fever, difficulty breathing or skin reactions immediately to your doctor and seek immediate emerency care if required. Report bleeding or hematoma, apply direct digital pressure and seek immediate emergency care. Report any sign of redness or increased pain to your doctor.</value></item><item><key>Imaging.Laterality</key><value>No</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Clinical Decision Support Requirements</key><value>Diagnostic Imaging to provide guidelines to support the lab and medication requirements for interventional radiography procedures.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Contraindications</key><value>Contrast Allergies: If there is a chance of an allergy to Contrast media, notify Diagnostic Imaging.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Patient Requirements</key><value>Laboratory: Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Blood Type and Screen required within 3 days of procedure. PT INR/PTT Group required within 48 hours (Inpatient) or 1 week (Outpatient) of procedure. CBC required within 48 hours (Inpatient) or 1 week (Outpatient) of procedure. For diabetic patients, check blood glucose on day of exam. Serum Creatinine and GFR required within 7 days of procedure. Emergency scans will not be delayed for GFR calculation. All inpatients who have any of the identified risk factors must have a serum creatinine obtained and a GFR calculated within 1 week prior to intravascular contrast media administration.
