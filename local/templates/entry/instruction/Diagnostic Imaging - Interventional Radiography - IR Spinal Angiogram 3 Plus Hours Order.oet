If sheath in situ, complete bedrest is required. Upon removal of sheath, complete bedrest as defined above for: 2 hours with Closure Device, 4 hours with NO Closure Device.;Vitals: Monitor vital signs, neuro vital signs, arterial site assessment and bilateral pedal pulses with extremity assessment post procedure, monitor for hematoma/bleeding with the following frequency: q15 minutes x 1 hour, q30 minutes x 1 hour until bedrest complete. Alternative frequency of vitals may be ordered as per Radiologist. Monitor arterial site, if bleeding/swelling occurs, apply pressure STAT as per protocol. If angioseal or percutaneous closure device insitu ensure proper technique followed.;For peripheral extremity, do not bend extremity distal to puncture site.;Change dressing if soiled. Assess for hematoma/bleeding at puncture site.;Notify Radiologist if procedural related concerns arise.;Patient may resume previous diet as tolerated post sheath removal.;Post procedural medications may be prescribed as per the Radiologist’s order.;Registered Nurse needs to be present for patient’s first ambulation to monitor groin for bleeding.;Keep existing IV/saline lock to keep vein open until sheath is pulled, discontinue running IV, keep saline lock IV until patient has ambulated and has no signs of bleeding.;Outpatient Post Procedure Care: Discharge Teaching: give patient Angiogram discharge information form. Teaching should include recovery from anesthetic or sedation, pain control, procedure related symptoms, activity restrictions, dressing care and post-procedural complications. Unusual symptoms including neurological or spinal changes, fever, difficulty breathing or skin reactions immediately to your doctor and seek immediate emerency care if required. Report bleeding or hematoma, apply direct digital pressure and seek immediate emergency care. Report any sign of redness or increased pain to your doctor.</value></item><item><key>Imaging.Laterality</key><value>No</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Clinical Decision Support Requirements</key><value>Diagnostic Imaging to provide guidelines to support the lab and medication requirements for interventional radiography procedures.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Contraindications</key><value>Contrast Allergies: If there is a chance of an allergy to Contrast media, notify Diagnostic Imaging.</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Patient Requirements</key><value>Laboratory: PT INR/PTT Group required within 48 hours (Inpatient) or 3 months (Outpatient) of procedure. CBC required within 48 hours (Inpatient) or 3 months (Outpatient) of procedure. For diabetic patients, check blood glucose on day of exam. Serum Creatinine and GFR required within 7 days (Inpatient) or 3 months (Outpatient) of procedure. Emergency scans will not be delayed for GFR calculation. All inpatients who have any of the identified risk factors must have a serum creatinine obtained and a GFR calculated within 1 week prior to intravascular contrast media administration. Risk factors for acute or chronic renal impairment and/or development of contrast induced nephropathy for adults are identified as: Diabetes mellitus, Renal disease or solitary kidney, Sepsis or acute hypotension, Dehydration or volume contraction, Age greater than 70 years, Previous chemotherapy, Organ transplant, Vascular disease (hypertension, congestive heart disease, cardiac or peripheral vascular disease), Nephrotoxic Drugs (Loop diuretics, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cancer and immune suppressant chemotherapy drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), Human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS).;Medications: Continue medications as usual with sip of water, excluding medications as directed by ordering provider (anticoagulants or diabetic medications). If the patient is on any blood thinning medications including Apixaban (Eliquis), Aspirin (ASA), Coumadin (Warfarin), Dabigatran (Pradax), Heparin (Enoxaparin, Dalteparin, Fragmin etc.) Plavix (Clopidogrel) or Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) consult with the ordering provider for instructions on holding medications. Consult with Diagnostic Imaging as required.;IV Requirements: IV Normal Saline locked off. If patient has Hereditary Hemmorhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) ensure proper filter used in initiation of IV access.;Nutrition: No solids 6 hours prior to procedure and continue clear fluids until 3 hours prior to procedure.;Vitals: Neuro and baseline vital signs required prior to DI procedure. Bilateral pedal pulses and extremity assessment in preparation for DI procedure.;Skin prep: Preoperative skin prep of bilateral groin, clip (10cm x 10cm).</value></item><item><key>Catalogue Pattern.Clinical Communication</key><value>Inpatient Clinical Communication: Patient in hospital attire with undergarments removed, intact hospital and applicable allergy ID bands. Personal needs of patient (e.g. use of washroom) must be attended to prior to leaving the ward. Consent is required. If the patient is unable to give consent independently, ensure that the co-decision maker or alternate decision maker(s) who have Power of Attorney, along with a legal consent form, accompany the patient to Diagnostic Imaging.  Send reading glasses/hearing aids. Notify department if a translator is required. Complete patient chart, including current medication record and vital signs record, must accompany patient to the Diagnostic Imaging department.;Outpatient Clinical Communcation: Signed consent will be required at the time of appointment. If the patient is unable to give consent independently, ensure that the co-decision maker or alternate decision maker(s) who have Power of Attorney, accompany the patient to Diagnostic Imaging. Bring reading glasses, hearing aids or a translator if required. Please follow the nutrition requirements: No solid foods 6 hours prior to procedure and continue clear fluids 3 hours prior to procedure. Continue medications with a sip of water. If you are on any blood thinning/anticoagulant medications please discuss with your doctor for instructions on holding. You are required to stay within city limits for 24 hours after the procedure.
