Blood work requirements will be assessed by the Access Coordinator and shall be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For diabetic patients, check blood glucose on day of exam. Serum Creatinine and GFR required within 7 days of procedure. Emergency scans will not be delayed for GFR calculation. All inpatients who have any of the identified risk factors must have a serum creatinine obtained and a GFR calculated within 1 week prior to intravascular contrast media administration. Risk factors for acute or chronic renal impairment and/or development of contrast induced nephropathy for adults are identified as: Diabetes mellitus, Renal disease or solitary kidney, Sepsis or acute hypotension, Dehydration or volume contraction, Age greater than 70 years, Previous chemotherapy, Organ transplant, Vascular disease (hypertension, congestive heart disease, cardiac or peripheral vascular disease), Nephrotoxic Drugs (Loop diuretics, amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cancer and immune suppressant chemotherapy drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), Human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS).;Medications: Continue medications as usual with sip of water, excluding medications as directed by ordering provider (anticoagulants or diabetic medications).
